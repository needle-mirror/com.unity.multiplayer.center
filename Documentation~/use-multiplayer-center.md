# Use the Multiplayer Center window

Open the Unity Multiplayer Center window by selecting **Window** > **Multiplayer** > **Multiplayer Center**.
To use the Multiplayer Center, do the following:

1. Use the **Recommendation** tab to generate recommended packages and solutions based on your game's requirements and install them.
2. Follow the examples and resources in the **Getting Started** tab to use the packages you installed.

## Generate recommended packages for a multiplayer game

To generate a list of packages that meet the needs of the multiplayer game you want to make, do the following: 

1. Enter an answer to each question about your game specifications. 
2. Examine the packages that the Multiplayer Center suggests are the best solutions for your game.

You can change your answers to generate different recommendations. If the suggested packages don't match your needs, you can select which packages to install or ignore.

## Install recommended packages

Select **Install Packages** to install the packages you selected. Unity then installs these packages and their dependencies in your project and automatically opens the Getting Started tab.

**Important**: If the Multiplayer Center detects that you have already installed any other multiplayer packages, a warning dialog appears to cancel the installation of those packages. To avoid breaking changes, backup your project before you continue. If you continue with the installation, Unity installs or upgrades the selected packages but doesn't remove existing packages. This can cause compatibility issues. To fix them, manually remove the conflicting packages from your project.
 

## Get started with the recommended packages

The Getting Started tab provides guidance, examples, and resources to help you use the packages that the Multiplayer Center installs. Follow this guidance in order to set up and use these packages. The Getting Started content can change based on the recommendations you selected in the Recommendations tab.
